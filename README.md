# README

## what is this?
This is a react-rails app, made with the help of the `react-rails` gem.

Its API endpoints are (mostly) TDD, with authentication handled by the `devise` gem.

Image uploads are handled with AWS and the `aws-s3` gem.

Styling is sped up with `Grommet` x `styled-components`.


## getting started
This runs on react-rails!

To get started, simply clone this repo and 
`bundle install` all the things! 

Then it's as easy as
`bundle exec rails s`!



## Things I wanted to do but let's face it - there's only so much time I'll spend on a challenge ❤️:
---
- [ ] full backend API test coverage
- [ ] React test coverage (easily implementable with Enzyme x Jest)
- [ ] Persisting login state on frontend
- [ ] Using jwt tokens to access user resources (photos)
- [ ] Much much much better styling 💅🏼
- [ ] More performant images (compression, multiple image sizes, etc)
- [ ] More modular React component structure x data propogation
